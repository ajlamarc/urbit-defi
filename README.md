# Self-hosted dYdX v4 Urbit Frontend

This client reduces dependency for dYdX users on the uptime / availability of the centralized frontend available at dydx.trade, and gives users a new way to access dYdX.

To learn more about Urbit, see https://urbit.org/.  The grant description is available [here](https://www.dydxgrants.com/grants/dydx-urbit-client).  

See [INSTALLATION](INSTALLATION.md) for how to install, and [DEVELOPMENT](DEVELOPMENT.md) for how to compile and release your own version over the Urbit network.
