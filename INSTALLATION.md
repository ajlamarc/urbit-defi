## Install the dYdX v4 frontend

Note that the dYdX v4 self-hosted frontend is **not available in certain locations (at the time of writing this, at least US and Canada)**. Attempting to access the self-hosted frontend in these locations will result in the frontend failing to fully connect. See the official dYdX Terms and Conditions and use at your own risk.

- Recommended to use Red Horizon or Tlon for a 100% free, managed and hosted Urbit server. See https://urbit.org/get-started for links, including instructions for self-hosting or running Urbit locally.
- Once you have an Urbit available, navigate to `https://<URL>/apps/landscape/` in a browser, replacing URL with the location of your local or cloud-running Urbit.
- Click the `Get Urbit Apps` button, enter the developer ID `~larryx-woldyr` and press `Enter`.
- The `dYdX v4` application should appear, click install.
- Clicking out of the pop-up should show a new `dYdX v4` tile on your home screen: please wait a few minutes for the installation to complete.
- Open the `dYdX v4` application from an allowed location and use as you would the centralized interface.

## Other notes

- Once you have installed the self-hosted frontend, it is yours and can be run forever, even if the developer distribution is terminated.
- Updates will be released much less frequently than the centralized interface. To see which version of the self-hosted frontend you have installed:
  - Hover over the installed tile in "Landscape", click the three lines, icon, and see the `Last Software Update` date and `Version`. The version numbers match those in the [dydxprotocol/v4-web](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-web/releases) repository.
- Contact [@ajlamarc](https://x.com/ajlamarc) to report any installation problems of this self-hosted frontend.
