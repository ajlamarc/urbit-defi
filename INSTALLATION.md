# Installation

> [!NOTE]  
> The Urbit dYdX v4 self-hosted frontend is **not available in certain locations (at the time of writing this, at least US and Canada)**. Attempting to access the self-hosted frontend in these locations will result in the frontend failing to fully connect. See the official dYdX Terms and Conditions and use at your own risk.

Described below is the easiest way to get on Urbit, using [Red Horizon](https://redhorizon.com/), an Urbit partner.  If you already have access to an Urbit and want access there instead, follow the standard Urbit app installation process, using the install path `~larryx-woldyr/dydx-v4`.

## Get a complimentary Urbit and boot dYdX v4

- Visit the dYdX Red Horizon fleet [here](https://redhorizon.com/join/e5cdcd14-446c-4a89-9151-d3d1811fd03c), enter an email for a new account, and login via the OTP.
- Select an Urbit ID from the available options and click continue.
- Copy the access key and click "Launch Urbit".  Paste in the access key at the login prompt.
- You should automatically be directed to the dYdX v4 frontend.
  - The self-hosted dYdX v4 frontend is also available on your mobile device, using the same URL currently open, and access key copied in the previous step.

### No available Urbit IDs

- If there are no available Urbit IDs at the above link, please contact [@ajlamarc](https://x.com/ajlamarc) and we will add more.  You may also launch one of Red Horizon's default Urbit IDs and install the dYdX v4 frontend as a separate step [by following the instructions in this video](https://www.loom.com/share/f3ba379261a642feac0b8ad210a70936?sid=09b3c1a1-b6e2-4e5b-ab8e-cf5bfe917ef6).

## Full self-hosting

Following the above instructions, you now have an Urbit managed and hosted by Red Horizon (a Chorus One company). I recommend keeping it here, as they cover server costs and provide update support 100% free at the time of writing.

### Self-hosting options

If you're looking for maximum security, you can export your Urbit from Red Horizon and self-host in multiple places: from your local computer via a CLI, from a Native Planet device, or your own VPS (Digital Ocean Droplet or equivalent).

- CLI: maximum security, runs on your local computer, also 100% free.  Requires a more technical understanding of Urbit and can't be accessed via mobile.
- Native Planet: also maximum security, runs on a dedicated computer for your Urbit.  Less technical, can be accessed via mobile, but you have to buy one of Native Planet's devices.
- VPS: Less secure since your cloud provider could censor.  Have to pay monthly cloud costs; would only recommend this over Red Horizon if you need more control over your Urbit (such as the ability to distribute apps).

### How to self-host

- On redhorizon.com, under "My Urbit" open the "More" dropdown and select Master Ticket.
- Read the instructions, select "Reveal Master Ticket", and save it somewhere secure.
- Go back, and in the dropdown, now select "Export" and read the instructions.  Click "Export" and then click "OK".  It may take 1-2 minutes to prepare your export.  If it appears to be stuck, refresh the page and select "Export" again.
- Download the export file (may be up to 500 MB - 1 GB).
- For your chosen self-hosting path, follow the relevant instructions to run your Urbit in the new location: [Native Planet](https://www.nativeplanet.io/), [Local CLI](https://docs.urbit.org/manual/getting-started/self-hosted/cli), or [VPS](https://docs.urbit.org/manual/getting-started/self-hosted/cloud-hosting).
  - The downloaded file from Red Horizon is compressed by `zstd`.  [You can decompress the file on Unix machines following the answer here.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45704163). If you need to move the downloaded file to your VPS or Native Planet device, recommend to do that before decompressing.

## Other notes

- Once you have installed the self-hosted frontend, it is yours and can be run forever, even if the developer distribution is terminated.  It currently depends on the same indexer / APIs as `dydx.trade`, however that can be changed with a new release.
- Updates will be released much less frequently than the centralized interface. To see which version of the self-hosted frontend you have installed:
  - Hover over the installed tile in "Landscape", click the three lines, icon, and see the `Last Software Update` date and `Version`. The version numbers match those in the [dydxprotocol/v4-web](https://github.com/dydxprotocol/v4-web/releases) repository. (If you access dYdX v4 at `https://<URL>/apps/dydx-v4/`, landscape is available at `https://<URL>/apps/landscape/`.)
- Contact [@ajlamarc](https://x.com/ajlamarc) to report any installation problems of this self-hosted frontend.
